## InfiniteLoader Linter Errors and Functionality Status

The incorrect `InstanceType` import has been removed from `src/Home.tsx`. This resolves one of the previous linter errors.

The following linter errors related to `InfiniteLoader` persist in `src/Home.tsx`:

1.  **`Property 'resetloadMoreItemsCache' does not exist on type 'ComponentType<InfiniteLoaderProps>'.`** (Seen on lines like 458 and 471 where `infiniteLoaderRef.current.resetloadMoreItemsCache()` is called)

    - **Explanation:** This error occurs because the `infiniteLoaderRef` (currently typed as `useRef<typeof InfiniteLoader | null>(null)`) is being interpreted by TypeScript as the type of the component constructor/function (`typeof InfiniteLoader`), not an actual instance of the `InfiniteLoader` component. The method `resetloadMoreItemsCache` is an instance method and is not found on the component's general type.
    - **Impact:** Calls to `resetloadMoreItemsCache()` will likely fail or do nothing. This means the `InfiniteLoader`'s cache won't be reset when the column count changes or when the number of gallery items changes. This could lead to issues like items not re-rendering correctly or incorrect item measurements after layout changes.

2.  **`Type '{ ... }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & InfiniteLoaderProps'. Property 'ref' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & InfiniteLoaderProps'.`** (Seen on the line where `<InfiniteLoader ref={infiniteLoaderRef} ... />` is rendered, e.g., line 557)
    - **Explanation:** TypeScript indicates that, based on its current understanding of `InfiniteLoaderProps` (the props for the `InfiniteLoader` component), it doesn't expect a prop named `ref`. If the `ref` prop isn't correctly recognized and assigned, then `infiniteLoaderRef.current` will not be correctly set to the `InfiniteLoader` instance.
    - **Impact:** This is critical for interacting with the `InfiniteLoader` instance. If `infiniteLoaderRef.current` remains `null` (its initial value), any attempts to call instance methods on it will fail.

These errors point to a deeper issue with how TypeScript is understanding or resolving the types for the `react-window-infinite-loader` component within your project, even with `@types/react-window-infinite-loader` installed. Resolving these would likely require more in-depth troubleshooting of your TypeScript setup (`tsconfig.json`), the specific type definitions provided by `@types/react-window-infinite-loader`, or potential conflicts.

**Regarding `InfiniteLoader` Functionality:**

- **Initial Load (200 images):** This should still work correctly. The `initialNumItems: 200` setting in your `usePaginatedQuery` hook controls this and is independent of the `InfiniteLoader` ref issues.
- **Subsequent Loads (100 images at a time):** This should also likely still work. `InfiniteLoader`'s core mechanism for detecting scroll boundaries and calling your `loadMoreItems` function (which then calls `loadMore(100)`) doesn't strictly depend on the `ref` working for these specific instance method calls.
- **Functionality Affected by Errors:** The main functionality at risk is the **cache resetting** via `resetloadMoreItemsCache()`. Without this working, you might encounter:
  - Stale data or incorrect item rendering after the grid's column count changes (e.g., on window resize).
  - Inefficient loading or display issues if the total number of gallery items changes significantly.

The gallery navigation features (arrows, keyboard, swipe) implemented recently should be functional as they don't directly rely on these `InfiniteLoader` instance methods.
