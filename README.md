# 1 Million Prompts | Track and generate AI images with OpenAI DALL·E 3 on Convex, Cooked with Chef

## About

1 Million Prompts is an AI image generator built on Convex, Convex Chef, and openai DALL·E 3 where every prompt counts toward a shared goal: generating one million images.
Create and share AI art, track progress in real-time, and explore a living gallery of prompts from the community.
It's not just an app—it's a global race to one million

## Features

- **AI Image Generation**:

  - Input custom text prompts to describe the desired image.
  - Utilize openai's DALL·E 3 model for high-quality image creation.
  - Select from a diverse range of predefined artistic styles (see below).
  - Monitor generation progress with a real-time loading indicator featuring cycling images and cooking-themed status words.

- **Artistic Style Selection**: Choose a style to influence the generated image:

  - Studio Laika (Stop-motion animation aesthetic)
  - 3D Soft (Smooth, Pixar-like animation style)
  - Ghibli (Painterly watercolor visuals)
  - 80s Anime (Classic retro anime look)
  - T206 Vintage (Early 20th-century baseball card style)
  - Futuristic (Sleek, high-tech visuals)
  - B&W (Classic black and white)

- **Community Gallery & Interaction**:

  - Browse generated images in a dynamic, responsive grid layout.
  - Images load progressively as you scroll or via a "Load More" button.
  - Click any image to open a modal for a larger view and details (prompt, style).
  - Interact with images in the modal: Add likes, view/add comments, and copy direct shareable links.

- **Global Goal Tracking**:

  - A prominent counter displays the total number of images generated by the community in real-time.
  - Tracks progress towards the collective goal of one million prompts.
  - Displays a celebratory message ("Greatness Modal") when the goal is reached.

- **Dashboard**:
  - View key statistics and trends.
  - See the total prompt count and goal progress.
  - Access different data views via tabs:
    - Last 20 Prompts
    - Last 20 Styles Used
    - All Prompts (paginated view)
    - 20 Most Liked Images
    - 20 Most Commented Images
  - Clickable prompts in tables link directly to the image view, incrementing a click counter.
