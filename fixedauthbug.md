## Bug: Admin Role Not Recognized in Convex Backend from Clerk JWT

**Attempts to Fix:** Approximately 6-7 major attempts involving diagnosis and code changes.

### Problem Description:

A new feature was added to allow admins to save a custom message for gallery items. The admin check was implemented in a Convex mutation (`addOrUpdateCustomMessage` via an `ensureAdminPrivileges` helper).

Despite the user (`wayne@convex.dev`) being correctly configured with `{"role": "admin"}` in their Public Metadata in the Clerk dashboard, and ensuring the Clerk JWT template included the `public_metadata` claim, the Convex backend consistently failed to recognize the admin role.

The Convex function logs for `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` showed that `identity.publicMetadata?.role` was evaluating to `undefined`, even though deeper logging of the entire raw `identity` object revealed that the JWT _did_ contain a field `"public_metadata": {"role": "admin"}`.

Other moderation features (like highlight/hide) initially appeared to work because their authentication check (`ensureAuthenticated`) was only verifying if the user was logged in, not if they possessed a specific admin role. When this was temporarily changed to use the stricter admin check, those features also began to fail, confirming the issue was with how the admin role was being retrieved or interpreted from the Clerk-issued JWT in the Convex backend.

### Root Cause:

The issue was a subtle but critical casing mismatch between the JWT claim name and the property name on the Convex `UserIdentity` object returned by `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`.

- The standard JWT claim for public metadata (as configured in the Clerk JWT template and shown in the raw token) is `public_metadata` (snake_case).
- The Convex `UserIdentity` type definition, or the way the `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` populates its returned object, was expected to provide this under a camelCase property `publicMetadata`.
- When we logged `JSON.stringify(identity.publicMetadata, null, 2)` (camelCase), it showed `undefined`.
- However, the log of the entire `identity` object showed the data was present under the key `"public_metadata"` (snake_case).

Our code was trying to access `identity.publicMetadata.role` (camelCase), which was `undefined` because the actual data was nested under `identity.public_metadata` (snake_case).

### Solution:

The fix was to modify the `ensureAdminPrivileges` helper in `convex/gallery.ts` to directly access the `public_metadata` field using snake_case from the `identity` object:

```typescript
// Inside ensureAdminPrivileges in convex/gallery.ts

// ... (identity fetching and initial logging) ...

// Access public_metadata with snake_case, as shown in the raw JWT log.
const clerkPublicMetadata = (identity as any).public_metadata as { role?: string } | undefined;

// ... (rest of the logic using clerkPublicMetadata?.role) ...
```

By changing `identity.publicMetadata` (camelCase) to `(identity as any).public_metadata` (snake_case) for retrieving the role information, the code could correctly find and parse the `{"role": "admin"}` object that was present in the JWT claim.

The `(identity as any)` type assertion was used to bypass TypeScript's strict type checking if the formal `UserIdentity` type definition didn't explicitly include a `public_metadata` (snake_case) property, allowing us to access the property that the raw logs confirmed was present.

This resolved the authorization issue, and the admin check then passed successfully.
